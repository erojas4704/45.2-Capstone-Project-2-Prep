## Proposals

1. A service website that allows users to manage and oversee ongoing computer repairs. It will use a custom API to allow SMS messages to be sent to and from the technicians.

2. Context. A website that allows users to chat with each other while a sidebar populates with relevant information regarding events, historical figures, people, and ideas.

3. A private photo album that allows users to upload photos and categorize them, only to be viewed by the owner.

4. A website that allows users to collect pokemon and have them battle with other users to gain money, using the pokemon API.

5. Am e-commerce site that allows users to post pictures of themselves and allow other users to recommend clothes that would look good on them.
